/**
 * @dev Interface for the Liquidity to Protocol Credit Delegation Pool
 */
interface IL2PPool {

  ////// Hypotheses
  //// limit to one asset : deposit dai to the pool / borrow dai from the pool
  // easier to integrate with only one asset
  // use only stablecoins to ease liquidation management
  //// be EXTREMELY conservative with borrowing ratios
  // 80% is the maximum debt ratio with dai as a collateral
  // let's set an internal limit to something like 50% to prevent users liquidating themselves
  //// use stable rates all the way (for both aave and the pool)

  ////// Questions
  // Should the debt rebalancing be managed onchain or not?
  // How should we dilute the risk between delegators?
  // Proposition : freeDebt takes an array of {address, amount} as input, to which the user's debt will be swapped
  // Proposition : borrow takes an array of {address, amount} as input, on behalf of who the pool will borrow
  // Proposition : these array are computed off chain in a backend service - less complexity on the smart contract, work is better split
  // Proposition : the goal is to make these input array as short as possible, bc the pool will have to call 

  ////// Subjects to be investigated
  // How to calculate borrower rates 
  // How to manage internal pdai/dai rates
  // How to handle pdai repayment

  ////// HAPPY FLOWS
  // DEPOSITOR DELEGATE : has dai in his account, calls delegate, receives adai and pdai
  // DEPOSITOR WITHDRAW : has adai and pdai, calls withdraw, debt is rebalanced, receives dai
  // BORROWER BORROW : calls borrow, debt is being spread into several delegators, receives dai
  // BORROWER REPAY : calls repay, sends dai, debt is being repayed for several delegators

  ////// data structures
  //// credit delegations management
  // total deposited per depositor
  // total borrowed per depositor
  // total borrowed per borrower
  // total borrowed in pool
  //// fees management
  // total fees accrued
  // pdai/dai rate
  // debt token/dai rate
